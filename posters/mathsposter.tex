How many 2D shapes have the properties of having all sides the same length and all angles the same measure and less than $\pi$ radians? 
\par 
There are infinitely many! 
These are called the regular polygons. 
Here are what the first few look like.

How many three-dimensional objects exist that have faces that are all the same regular polygon?
For example we have the cube that is made by joining six square faces. The answer to this is less obvious. 
There are exactly five! 

\begin{center}

\begin{itemize}
\item the \emph{tetrahedron} formed of 4 equilateral triangles,
\item the \emph{cube} formed of 6 squares,
\item the \emph{octahedron} formed of 8 equilateral triangles,
\item the \emph{dodecahedron} formed of 12 regular pentagons,
\item and the \emph{icosahedron} formed of 20 equilateral triangles.
\end{itemize}

These are called the \emph{regular polyhedra} or sometimes the \emph{Platonic solids}.

\headerbox{Regular 4D Polytopes}{name=regular_polytopes4D,column=1}{

We can make a four-dimensional object by connecting together some three-dimensional volumes similarly to how we make a three-dimensional object by joining some two-dimensional faces. 
There are exactly six regular four-dimensional objects that can be formed by joining regular polyhedra together. 
These are 
\par \quad
\begin{itemize}
\item the \emph{4-simplex} formed of 5 tetrahedra,
\item the \emph{4D hypercube} formed of 8 cubes,
\item the \emph{4D hyperoctahedron} formed of 16 tetrahedra,
\item the \emph{hyperdodecahedron} formed of 120 dodecahedra,
\item the \emph{hypericosahedra} formed of 600 tetrahedra,
\item and the \emph{24-cell} formed of 24 octahedra.
\end{itemize}
\par \quad
The first five regular four-dimensional polytopes described above are very similar to the five regular polyhedra. The 24-cell however appears to be unique.

\headerbox{Regular Polytopes in Higher Dimensions}{name=regular_polytopes5d,column=1,
below = regular_polytopes4D, bottomaligned = regular_polyhedra}{

We can generalise this idea by creating an $n$-dimensional regular polytope. 
An $n$-dimensional regular polytope is an $n$-dimensional object formed by joining repeated, identical, regular $(n-1)$-dimensional polytopes all at the same angles.
\par 
Perhaps disapointingly, there only exist three $n$-dimensional regular polytopes for any $n \ge 5$. 

These are:
\par \quad

\par \quad
\begin{itemize}
\item the $n$-dimensional simplex formed of $(n+1)$ different $(n-1)$-dimensional simplices,
\item the $n$-dimensional hypercube formed of $2n$ different $(n-1)$-dimensional hypercubes,
\item the $n$-dimensional hyperoctahedron formed of $2^n$ different $(n-1)$-dimensional simplices.
\end{itemize}
\quad \par 
Regular polytopes are interesting to mathematicians partly because they have a lot of symmetry, leading to interesting properties.

\headerbox{2 Dimensional Cross-Sections}{name=cross2,column=2, bottomaligned = regular_polyhedra}{

Imagine living in a flat, two-dimensional world. Familiar to us in this world are points, lines and two-dimensional shapes like the square and triangles.
We can see in two perpendicular directions: left and right, forward and backwards but there wouldn't exist a third perpendicular direction that we can use to look up and down.

\par
\quad
\par 
Now let's suppose we want to know what a three-dimensional object like a cube might look like. 
Since we don't have a third dimension in which to use to go up or down we cannot see it directly. 
The idea of having a cube might seem absurd: six squares joined together using an angle perpendicular to the only two in our world!
We can learn about what a cube might be like by examining its two-dimensional cross-sections as it passes through our two-dimensional world. 
If the cube passes straight down through with one of its faces parallel to our two-dimensional world we see a square suddenly appear and disappear! 

\par
\begin{centering}
\includegraphics[clip,trim={3cm 3.2cm 3cm 3cm},scale = 0.9]{cube_slice_1}
\end{centering}
From this information we might be able to get a good idea of what this three-dimensional object might be like. 
We could imagine that a cube is like a square being \emph{dragged} in the third dimension that we cannot see!
\par
\quad
\par 
We might think that a cube passing through our two-dimensional world \emph{always} suddenly produces a square that disappears but this isn't true.
What other polygons can it make this way?
Given that a cube has only six faces it must be impossible to make a polygon with seven or more edges. 
So is it possible to make a triangle, pentagon or pentagon? 
Yes! 
In fact here is a rotated cube passing through that produces all of these cross-section polygons.

What does it look like for a four-dimensional shape to travel through our three-dimensional world?
Clearly in our three-dimensional world we can move in three perpendicular directions: 
left and right, forward and backward and up and down. 
But in a four-dimensional space we imagine there is another direction we can travel in which is perpendicular to these three too! 
\par 
Similar to how a three-dimensional shape leaves a two-dimensional cross-section when it passes through a two-dimensional space, when a four-dimensional shape passes a three-dimensional space it leaves a three-dimensional cross-section. 
So what does it look like for a four-dimensional hypercube to pass through our three-dimensional world?
To the right (upper) we see one passing through with one of it's volumes parallel to our three-dimensional world. 
We see a cube suddenly appear then disappear! 
This suggests that a four-dimensional hypercube is like a three-dimensional cube being \emph{dragged} in the fourth dimension we cannot see. 
\par
However, this is not the only way a four-dimensional hypercube can pass through. To the right (lower) we see what it looks like for a four-dimensional hypercube to pass through at a different angle.

\headerbox{Regular 2D Tessellations}{name=tes2,column=3, bottomaligned = cross3cube}{
\par
We say that a finite set of two-dimensional shapes tessellate in two dimensions if we can tile a plane with those shapes without any gaps or over laps. 
\par
\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0\textwidth}
    \includegraphics[clip,trim={1.0cm 2.0cm 1.0cm 2.0cm},scale = 1.0]{tessellations_2d}
\end{wrapfigure}
\par
For example, to the right we have three examples of regular polygons tessellating a plane : 
the square, the regular hexagon and the equilateral triangle. 
\par \quad \par
Do more regular polygons tessellate? 
To answer this question we will first measure the interior angle of any regular n-gon. 
\par
\quad
\par
By drawing a line from a single vertex to to every other vertex in the regular polygon we can see that the least amount of triangles we can split an n-gon into is $n-2$ triangles. 
Since the sum of angles in a triangle is $\pi$ radians, and each interior angle of the $n$-gon is partitioned by the triangles, the sum of interior angles of the $n$-gon is $(n-2)\pi$.
All the angles in a regular n-gon are equal and there are n of the angles, as a result each interior angle has a measure of $\frac{(n-2)\pi}{n}.$ 
\par
\quad
\par
For a regular n-gon to tessellate, we must have that we can get some integer, $k$, amount of n-gons around a given vertex with no gaps and no over lapping. So the sum of the $k$ n-gon's interior angles must be $2\pi.$
As an equation this tells us that $\frac{(n-2)k\pi}{n} = 2\pi $.
\par \quad
\par


Since the interior angle formula shows us that an interior angle is always less than $\pi$ for a regular n-gon to tessellate there must 3 or more of the same sized n-gon around a vertex without any gaps. So $k \ge 3$. So
\par
\quad
\par
\begin{align*}
 \frac{(n-2)k\pi}{n} = 2\pi 
  \implies  \frac{2n}{n-2} = k \ge 3 
  \iff n \le 6.
\end{align*}
\par
\quad
\par
So it's impossible for any regular n-gon to tessellate for $n \ge 7$. Now we can solve for $k$ in our equation $k = \frac{2n}{n-2}$ by putting $n = 3,4,5$ and $6$.
Doing this gives us 
\quad \par
\begin{itemize}
\item $k = 6$ for $n = 3$, 
\item $k = 4$ for $n = 4$, 
\item $k = \frac{10}{3}$ for $n = 5$  
\item and $k = 3$ for $n = 6$.
\end{itemize} 
\quad \par
But for $n = 5$ we would need a non-integer amount of pentagons around a vertex which is absurd! So triangles, squares and hexagons are the only regular polygons that tessellate after all. 

\par\quad\par

Now let's take a look at a couple of other four-dimensional objects travelling through the three-dimensional world. Here we see the hyper-icosahedron (above) and hyper-dodecahedron (below). In these examples we see that a variety of interesting polyhedra are formed this way.
For this case of the hyper-icosahedron we suddenly an icosahedron suddenly appear and then grow. 
Then each vertex on the icosahedron suddenly becomes a pentagon split up into 5 elevated non-equilateral triangles and expands. After this it seems we see that a geodesic sphere of 60 triangles has been formed before a similar process occurs to form a geodesic sphere with 80 triangular faces. The process then seems to reverse again and the objects disappears. 

\par \quad
\par \quad

For the hyper-dodecahedron we observe similar behaviour : suddenly a dodecahedron appears. 
Then the vertices transform into expanding triangular faces and we observe a variety of different polyhedra including the truncated icosahedron in the middle of the process which is also known for the iconic football design.

\headerbox{Duality}{name = duality, column=0,  
below = cross3other, }{
Take a cube and imagine a point in the center of each square face.
Now take a point and connect it with a line to the points that lie in the square faces that touch the square face of the original point. Do this for all the points on the cube and what do we get?
\par
It's an octahedron inside a cube! 
We say that octahedron is \textbf{dual} to the cube. 
In fact it's also true that 
\quad \par
\begin{itemize}
\item the tetrahedron is dual to itself,
\item the cube and octahedron are dual to each other,
\item and the icosahedron and dodecahedron are dual to each other.
\end{itemize}
\par
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[clip,trim={2cm 1.25cm 2cm 1cm},scale = 0.75]{dual_platonic_solids}
\end{center}
\par

Similarly, in four dimensions we can start with a point in the center of a volume and join the dots of adjacent volumes to find that
\quad \par
\begin{itemize}
\item the four-dimensional simplex is dual to itself,
\item the four-dimensional hypercube and four-dimensional hyper-octahedron are dual to each other,
\item the hyper-icosahedron and hyper-dodecahedron are dual to each other,
\item and the 24-cell is dual to itself.
\end{itemize}
For $n\ge 5$ we just have that the $n$-dimensional simplex is dual to itself while the $n$-dimensional hypercube and hyper-octahedron are dual to one another.

A set of three-dimensional objects tessellate if we can tile a three-dimensional space with no gaps or overlap with those three-dimensional objects.
One familiar example of how to do this is to use cubes. What other objects have this property?
\par \quad \par
One way we can produce more tessellations is by taking three-dimensional cross-sections of objects that tessellate in higher dimensions. For example, the regular four-dimensional polytope, the 24-cell. We can take this object and rotate it using four perpendicular directions and then look at the intersection this has with our three-dimensional world. To the left are three examples of this:
\quad \par
\begin{itemize}
\item the first example, at the top, shows a regular tessellation of the rhombic-dodecahedron, 

\item the second example, in the middle, shows an octahedron and a cuboctahedron tessellating,

\item the third example seems slightly more complex. It seems to consist of two different three-dimensional objects that use non-regular hexagons, isosceles kites and rhombi as faces. 
\end{itemize}
\quad \par
This method of using relatively simple four-dimensional tessellations, rotating them and then taking an intersection could be generalised. Why not take an $n$-dimensional tessellating object, rotate it and then take an intersection of it in a lower dimension? By doing this we might be able to take relatively simple $n$-dimensional tessellating objects to produce more complex tesselating objects in a lower dimension.
